                <p>Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) has been trying to emphasize the importance of composting since 2012. Facilities Management Services’ Green Team started the change by placing composting bins in various dining locations across campus, working together with Dining Services to compost waste as workers cook, as well as encouraging students to compost leftovers from their own meals. Currently, CMU is working with <a href="https://ag-recycle.com" target="_blank">AgRecycle</a>, a composting facility just 10 minutes from campus.

                <p>Since AgRecycle is a composting facility, its composting system works differently that of a homemade compost pile. Typically, fish, meat, and most dairy products are not recommended for composting; however, AgRecycle’s facilities can process them, meaning that you can toss any food scraps from your meals into compost bins on campus without worry. The bags inside compost bins, which hold your compostable waste, are compostable as well, and they break down naturally once processed by AgRecycle.

                <p>When you use a composting bin on campus, your scraps are transported from campus to AgRecycle, where they are made into either mushroom compost (a specific type of compost rich in soluble salts) or shredded bark mulch. These are then integrated into soil-compost mixes. AgRecycle sells these soil-compost mixes, which go back into the local community, enriching the backyard gardens and greenspaces of Pittsburgh.

                <p>Currently, there are composting bins available at Schatz, The Underground, Resnik, and the Tepper Quad. CMU is in the process of switching from plastic products to compostable products, so that all plates, utensils, and cups will be able to be repurposed after they are thrown away. Some dining locations have already switched only compostable products, such as Schatz. Other locations still use a mix of compostable and non-compostable products. Be on the lookout: check your utensils, cups, and food cartons to see if they’re compostable. If they are, make sure to throw them into composting bins. Commercially compostable products will not break down in landfills, which don’t provide the right conditions for biodegradation.
