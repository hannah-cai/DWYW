            <section>
                <p>Composting is a process of recycling organic material which both reuses waste and reduces the amount of waste that goes to landfills. Generally, all organic material can be used for composting; most artificial or man-made materials aren’t biodegradable, so avoid throwing items made of plastic, aluminum, or glass into composting bins. In order for composting to work, you need a mix of “brown waste” and “green waste,” which supply the carbon and nitrogen that drive the cycle. “Brown waste” includes biodegradable products that are carbon based, such as leaves, paper, and cardboard; “green waste” includes all other organic biodegradable waste, like plant materials, hair, and food waste. These materials decompose naturally to form a nutrient-rich material called compost. When added to soil, compost enriches and fortifies the mixture to create healthier soil.

                <p>Compost can be used as fertilizer, natural pesticide, and conditioner for soil. When added as a blanket layer to landscapes, it can also help reduce erosion and retain soil moisture, aiding the reconstruction of wetlands and bodies of water. As a fertilizer, compost is also often used to boost the growth of fruits, vegetables, and other plants, making it a valuable resource in industry.

                <p>As a movement, composting helps extend the lifespans of currently existing landfills, as well as discourage the construction of new ones. Composting diverts reusable waste from going to landfills in the first place, which decreases the rate of landfill growth. It can also help reduce the cost and consequences of waste transportation. <a href="https://ag-recycle.com" target="_blank">AgRecycle</a>, the composting company Carnegie Mellon works with, has a facility that's only a three mile drive from campus. On the other hand, the nearest landfill, Reserve Park Landfill, lies six miles away from campus. Obviously, dropping compostable waste off at AgRecycle, instead of at Reserve Park Landfill, saves a lot of gas every year, which therefore cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions each year as well.

                <p>However, the benefits of composting, instead of landfilling, go deeper than just ease of transportation. Have you ever wondered what happens to food after it goes in the trash? In landfills, waste is often packaged in plastic trash bags before being dropped off. Plastic bags don’t biodegrade, which means they don’t break down into organic materials naturally. Due to this, trash bags can take 10-1000 years to decompose. Food and other organic matter left in these plastic bags are deprived of oxygen, a crucial component for aerobic (or “air”) decomposition, which is what normally happens in nature. Organic matter can still decompose without oxygen in a process called anaerobic (or “without air”) decomposition, but the process is significantly slower. In some cases, food scraps from over 25 years ago have been dug up practically untouched.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to being slower, anaerobic decomposition also produces methane gas. About 50% of gas produced at landfills consists of methane, and the other half generally consists of carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is generally referenced most often when the terms “greenhouse gases” or “global warming” are brought up in conversation, but methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas—it’s roughly thirty times more effective at trapping heat than CO2 is. Landfills are a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, so composting can actually help combat climate change.
                </p>
                <p>Since composting slows the growth of landfills and cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions, all while creating an organic fertilizer and soil stabilizer, you can see why it’s a worthy cause that many people have rallied behind, including Carnegie Mellon’s Facilities Management Services and Dining Services.
